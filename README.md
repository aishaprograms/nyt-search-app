## Getting Started
Visit the Heroku app:

* **NYT Search** - [NYT Search](https://frozen-brook-69554.herokuapp.com/)

## Updates
02/28/2017: New articles are added to the top of the list instead of the bottom. The list is sorted by object id in a descending order.

## Understand
Saved articles are stored on the Mongo database. Each article has a
- title (Title of the stored article from nytimes.com)
- date (publish date and time of the article)
- url (URL of the article on nytimes.com)

This is a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses react-router to navigate, hide and show the React components without changing the route within Express. React-router uses hash history.

The higher level React components are the following:  
* **Main** - contains the main-container div that holds the main layout and navigation. This component also holds sub-components Search and Saved
* **Search** - queries the NYT API for articles. Displays API search results from **Form** component and **Results** component. Gives the user the ability to save an article to Saved Articles
* **Saved** - displays the Saved Articles that were searched and stored in the database
